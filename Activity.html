     <p>Great views of Seoul. We took the cable car this trip, but previous trips I hiked up to the top. Their is an extra fee to go up in the tower.</p>

     <p>The right spot to observe magnificient Seoul from above. We went there during peak time of Korean autumn which so miraculous, feel the air and feel the view.
        But you have to be patient to queue for the cable car.</p>

        <p>If you want to see the city lights, then go at night. There is a cable car that you can catch for a price that will wisk you up the hillside. You then need to buy a ticket to go up the Tower. We were there during the day and there was a free Korean dancer performance. There is a gift shop with some interesting finds and also more shopping. You can even hike down through Namsan Park, if you wish.</p>
